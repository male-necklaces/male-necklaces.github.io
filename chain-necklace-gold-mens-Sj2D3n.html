<p>*   <strong>18 Inches:</strong> This length usually sits at the base of the neck, often visible just above a crew-neck shirt. It's subtle and ideal for a refined, minimalist aesthetic.
*   <strong>20 Inches:</strong> A popular choice, sitting slightly below the collarbone. This length works well with most necklines, including open-collar shirts, and is great for showcasing a small pendant.
*   <strong>22 Inches:</strong> This length falls mid-chest and is excellent for larger pendants or layering with shorter chains. It offers a more relaxed, casual vibe.
*   <strong>24 Inches and Longer:</strong> These lengths hang lower on the chest, perfect for making a bold statement with substantial pendants or for wearing over sweaters and hoodies. They're often seen in `hip hop jewelry for guys` and bolder `men's chains`.</p>
